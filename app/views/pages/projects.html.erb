        <p class="med-text">This code is the base framework I created for this
        very site you are looking at right now.  Although my main 
        <a href="https://github.com/SilverFox70/SF70-Blog"></a>repo has some
        subtle differences, the bones are the same. Rails 4.2.5 with a 
        bootstrap based front end, a mix of Javascript, jQuery, HTML and CSS
        all helping out. Postgres is the database behind the scenes.</p> 
        <p class="med-text">Devise is used to handle security and authentication,
        while ActiveAdmin is employed to handle administration duties, like
        monitoring and deleting comments, or adding posts. This repo may be forked
        for your own use or you can contribute to making a free, Rails-based
        blog framework and submit pull requests for refactoring or additional
        features.</p>

        <p class="med-text">This was my final project at DevBootcamp SF. In the live
        production/entertainment industry there is a pile of paperwork that must be
        generated and maintained. This paperwork is necessary for the programming and
        installation of all of the lighting equipment used.  Mastercraft Lighting is
        database software specifically tailored for use in the arena of live events
        and productions.</p>

        <p class="med-text">I developed this as an alternate, improved way to program
        Sunnywell LED signs. We had to program formatted text into the signs every day
        at work, but the software the signs shipped with was terrible for our purposes.
        So, I started by using an RS-232 sniffer to capture the data stream their software
        output to the signs. Once I understood the "language" the signs spoke, I started to
        develop my own software to program them. </p>
        <p class="med-text">The program loads up a form, dependent on settings you input
        in a config file, and then takes the user input from the form and produces the
        'sign-ready' data.  A third party plug-in allows the program to send the data to
        the Sunnywell signs.</p>
