      <h2>Welcome to my site!</h2>
      <p class="svfty-font">This site is a personal catch-all for me.
      I have a blog on computer science and technology, a portfolio of
      projects I am working on, and other easter eggs as they come up.
      Registration and Login is so that you can leave comments on the
      blog.</p>
      <p class="svfty-font">I am a full-stack web developer, which means
      I am comfortable using frameworks like Rails and Sinatra; HTML5,
      CSS3, and Bootstrap, with Javascript and jQuery for front end; and
      SQLite3, Postgresql, and Neo4j as Databases. I also enjoy tinkering
      in Java and C#. </p>
